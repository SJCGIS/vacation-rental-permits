# Vacation Rental Permits

This is not an exhaustive list of permits and there may be vacation rental permits not shown on the map. This map does not include permits for hotels, motels, resorts, or bed and breakfasts.

Dates of Application, Approval, Issue, Withdraw, or Deny are blank where unknown. The effective date for the permit status for each permit is the Decision Date field.

## Progressive Web App

Vacation Rental Permits is an example of a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive). Some of the progressive features of Vacation Rental Permits include:

* Offline-Capable - using [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to store the application assets and a limited number of basemap tiles in the web browser cache that can be loaded when the network is not available. However, not all map data is available offline in all areas or zoom levels.

* Installable - Vacation Rental Permits can be installed on some mobile devices. This adds an icon to the homescreen to quickly start the app. The option to install the app may appear as a banner option when the page is loaded in a mobile browser, or it may be installed later from an "Add to Homescreen" option in the browser menu.

* Performant - Vacation Rental Permits is optimized for very fast performance. The application should load in under five seconds in most cases.
