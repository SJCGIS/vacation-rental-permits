# Vacation Rental Permits
This map shows the location of parcels as assigned on vacation rental permits since 1990. Mapped locations are not the actual locations of rental houses. This is not an exhaustive list of permits and there may be vacation rental permits not shown on the map. This map does not include permits for hotels, motels, resorts, or bed and breakfasts.

Dates of Application, Approval, Issue, Withdraw, or Deny are blank where unknown. The effective date for the permit status for each permit is the Decision Date field.
